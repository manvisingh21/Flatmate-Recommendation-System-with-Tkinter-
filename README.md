Content-Based Filtering Algorithm:

Content-based filtering recommends items based on user preferences and item characteristics. In this code, content-based filtering is applied to recommend flatmates. Features such as age, gender, personality, occupation, and lifestyle preferences are used to create a user profile. TF-IDF vectorization is applied to represent these features as a numerical vector. Then, a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used to find flatmates whose characteristics are similar to the user's preferences. The algorithm calculates the cosine similarity between the user profile vector and the vectors representing other flatmates, returning the closest matches.

Explanation of Code:

This Python script utilizes several libraries for different functionalities. `tkinter` is used for creating the graphical interface, allowing users to input preferences through dropdown menus. `pandas` is employed for loading and preprocessing the dataset containing flatmate information. `sklearn` libraries, including `TfidfVectorizer` and `NearestNeighbors`, are utilized for content-based filtering. The `TfidfVectorizer` converts text data into numerical vectors using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scheme. These vectors represent flatmate features. The `NearestNeighbors` algorithm, part of `sklearn.neighbors`, finds the nearest neighbors based on cosine similarity. Overall, the script combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to provide personalized recommendations for finding compatible flatmates.
